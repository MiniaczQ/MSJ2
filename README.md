Long description:
MSJ2 provides a fast and easy to use co-op server management.
Port redirection allows for one address to access all servers in a cyclic fashion.
Discord integration allows for an easy status check.
Servers automatically restart when needed to.

Project was stopped due to co-op sessions not happening.
